# Strings in Python are surronded by either single quotation marks, or double quoatation marks

# 'Hello' is the same as "Hello"
print('Hello')
print("Hello")

# You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

print("He is called 'Felipe'")
print('He is called "Felipe"')

# You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes or three single quotes:

a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, 
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt 
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""

print(a)
