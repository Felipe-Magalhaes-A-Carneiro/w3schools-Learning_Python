# Operators 
# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

#Arithmetic operators
a = 10 + 6
a = 10 - 6
a = 10 * 6
a = 10 / 6
a = 10 % 6
a = 10 ** 6 # exponentiation
a = 10 // 6 # floor division

#Assignment operators

#Comparison operators

#Logical operators

#Identity operators

#Membership operators

#Bitwise operators
