# Indentation is very important to python. This programming languages ues identation to indicate a block of code:

if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!") 

# Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

if 2 < 5:
    print("Two is less than five!")

# The number of spaces is up to you, the most common use is four, but it has to ve at least one.
